This program runs best in the Python IDLE environment.

1. Open the Memory_Driver.py file useing the Python IDLE IDE
2. Run the module (F5).

The module may or may not execute properly as we were not able to completely debug the 
program befor the dealine. However, we fully intend on completing the memory management
simulation algorithm beyond the scope of this course. This was a fun and challenging
experiment.
